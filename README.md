# StudentTeacherCollection


For this activity you will be assigning Students to Teachers using Lists, Sets and a Map

Getting Started  

Open up a new project in IntelliJ.

Assignment  

Create a Student JavaBean (empty constructor and getters and setters)

firstName
lastName
id
grade
In the main() method of Main create an ArrayList of 15 students which represents all the 1st grade students at an elementary school. Make sure the ids are unique and set the grade to 1.

Generate equals(), hashCode() and toString() using IntelliJ. Re-write equals() and hashCode() to use the id variable.

The Teacher class is the same as the Student class (Hint: you could use this fact to save yourself some time) Teacher

firstName
lastName
id
grade
Instantiate 3 Teachers just like you did for Students and add to an ArrayList of teachers.

Code a HashMap that takes a Teacher for a key and a Set of students for the value (not a List of students). Each Teacher will have 5 different students in a HashSet.

Print out the map keys in a for loop (use the keySet() method). Print out the map values in a for loop (use the values() method).
